        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>I love romance and romance poetry! In the initial conception of this project, I was going to pull the most common words from romantic comedy scripts, but I find lorem ipsums poetic and poetry just seemed more fun! I pulled romance poetry from poetry websites (with Beautiful Soup) and made a small word-counter python program (nothing special, it works like most of them!) to find the most common words in them, grabbed those words, cleaned the data (removed words like "the" and "a"), and then randomized them! I did want to start it off as romantically as possible, though, so some of my human influence changed the arrangements!</p>
