# lovemkissem
a website for my romance poetry generated lorem ipsum! 💕 

# about
i used Beautiful Soup to grab romance poems, found the words that occurred the most in the poetry (with obvious exclusions) and scrambled the words to create a lorem ipsum generator! the creation of the words used in the generator was done entirely in python. for the web, the site was built with javascript. i love love! i want love to be in everything i do, so i wanted to make a lorem ipsum pulled from that source. intially i was going to use rom-com scripts, but i thought poetry was more tech anyway (: 

# ❤️️ bonus!❤️️
i added lovem kissem to Visual Studio Code as its own snippet! you can watch or read how to do it on the website, and then you just type in 'love' + ENTER or RETURN to get a lovem kissem paragraph! ❤️️
