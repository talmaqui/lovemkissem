# lovemkissem
a website for my romance poetry generated lorem ipsum! 💕 

# about

note: repo was private but i'm not using github pro anymore, so give me a while to get the site visible again lol

i used Beautiful Soup to grab romance poems, found the words that occurred the most in the poetry (with obvious exclusions) and scrambled the words to create a lorem ipsum generator! the creation of the words used in the generator was done entirely in python. for the web, the site was built with javascript. i love love! i want love to be in everything i do, so i wanted to make a lorem ipsum pulled from that source. intially i was going to use rom-com scripts, but i thought poetry was more tech anyway (: 

# ❤️️ bonus!❤️️
i added lovem kissem to Visual Studio Code as its own snippet! you can watch or read how to do it on the website soon (i need to upload the tutorial for adding it to VSCode), and then you just type in 'love' + ENTER or RETURN to get a lovem kissem paragraph! ❤️️

second bonus: will show ya how to make your own lorem ipsum this way if you want. (:
